    <!--Poem-->
    <p>
        I met a traveller from an antique land, <br>
        Who said-"Two vast and trunkless legs of stone <br>Stand in the desert .... Near them, on the sand, <br>Half sunk a shattered visage liess, whose frown, <br>
        And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, <br> Tell that its sculptor well those passion read <br> which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, <br>The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed; <br> And on the pedestal, these words appear: <br> My name is <span>Ozymandias</span>, King of Kings; <br> Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair! <br> Nothing beside remain. round the decay <br> Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare <br>The lone and level sands stretch far away, " <br>
